So for the next two lessons (2-3) I went back to the same "Get Dancing" project and did a couple things, i will explain more below on exactly what i did. 


##### "Classic ELectric Piano"

I took a different path on the audio recording segment, instead of recording actual audio with a microphone, i programmed a set of notes on a Logic software instrument. I used the "Classic Electric Piano" preset for this, and it is around 4 bars long, I substituted it for the guitar that you were initially supposed to use. I also added a total of 3 plug-ins, only of them being time-based which is a reverb plug-in.



##### "Space Designer" Plug-in

I added this because the piano was sounding bland and I didn't like how the piano didn't have a good amount of release. The preset I used was "Piano Reflection". This plug-in is my favorite out of all the reverbs that are available. 



##### Build Up Wave

I then added this wave sample so every drop had a build up to it, at the end of the 15th bar and the 23rd bar. I also cut the file into a smaller fraction and faded it in so it sounded like it was building up gradually.



##### Colors Window Tip

 A tip really useful to me is changing the colors on files because you never forget which one is which and it keeps everything organized and colorful. You can do this by pressing (Option + C) and will change the color on one singular file but if you press (Shift + Option + C) it will change colors on however many files you clicked while holding shift.
