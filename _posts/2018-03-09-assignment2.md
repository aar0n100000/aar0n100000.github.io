So for the next two lessons (2-3) I went back to the same "Get Dancing" project and did a couple things, i will explain more below on exactly what i did. 


##### "Classic ELectric Piano"

I took a different path on the audio recording segment, instead of recording actual audio with a microphone, i programmed a set of notes on a Logic software instrument. I used the "Classic Electric Piano" preset for this, and it is around 4 bars long, I substituted it for the guitar that you were initially supposed to use. I also added a total of 3 plug-ins, only of them being time-based which is a reverb plug-in.



##### "Space Designer" Plug-in

I added this because the piano was sounding bland and I didn't like how the piano didn't have a good amount of release. The preset I used was "Piano Reflection"
