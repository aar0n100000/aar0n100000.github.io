Both lessons 5 and 6 are about working with MIDI mainly. both projects weren't too complicated each one consisted of about 3 different patches if i'm not mistaken.


##### Retro Synth

First it asked for a 'Retro Synth' patch and I edited it a little bit, I added some pitch bend and lowered some of the attack so it would sound more like a pad. This was a majority of the song until I made a bridge for a small section of the song.
