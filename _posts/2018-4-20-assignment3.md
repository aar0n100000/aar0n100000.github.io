##### Overview

Both lessons 5 and 6 are about working with MIDI mainly. both projects weren't too complicated each one consisted of about 3 different patches if i'm not mistaken.


##### Retro Synth

First it asked for a 'Retro Synth' patch and I edited it a little bit, I added some pitch bend and lowered some of the attack so it would sound more like a pad. This was a majority of the song until I made a bridge for a small section of the song.


##### Arpeggiator

For the little section i was talking about I duplicated the track that the retro synth was in but except in this one i added an arpeggiator plugin and it made a note play every 1/8th of a bar. After this section it went back to the original way without an arpeggiator.

##### Drummer

On the next lesson you had to make a drum pattern by changing the midi notes and had to make a simple drum pattern that loops every 8 bars. one of the drum pattern sounds a little syncopated but I think it was intentional.
